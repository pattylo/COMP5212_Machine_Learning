# Machine Learning

<p align="justify">This is a personal learning log and playground of Machine Learning. The content here was the learning material of mine when taking COMP5212, which was taught by Dr. Minghao Cheng from Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The syllabus of the course covers linear models, theory of generalization, DNNs, NLP, adversarial training, tree-models, unsupervised learning.</p>

<p align="justify">Separated by several folders, this repo contains all the conducted homework and mini-project (more can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/pattylo/ledvo">this repo</a>), while some trial code will also be included here. I hope the shared documents could someday be other learners' reference material when doing this subject. Enjoy :)</p>
